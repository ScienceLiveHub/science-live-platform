# Science Live Platform

**Transforming research into connected, machine-readable knowledge**

---

## What is Science Live?

Science Live addresses one of the most pressing challenges in modern research: **knowledge silos** that prevent effective collaboration and discovery across disciplines, institutions, and research domains.

We transform narrative scientific results into structured, machine-actionable data using **nanopublications** — the smallest units of publishable information. This creates a global network of interconnected scientific knowledge that is:

- **Findable** — Discover research across all disciplines
- **Accessible** — Open, decentralized infrastructure  
- **Interoperable** — Standards-based semantic integration
- **Reusable** — Build upon validated components

Think of it as the **Hugging Face of science** — where instead of pre-trained AI models, we provide validated research components ready for your domain.

## Our Mission

To accelerate scientific discovery by making research findings more accessible, interpretable, and reusable through semantic knowledge graphs and decentralized publishing.

### The Workflow
```
Navigate → Publish → Verify → Apply
```

From systematic, PRISMA-compliant search through connected research, to instant structured publishing, community validation, and validated components ready for real-world implementation.

## How Nanopublications Work

Each nanopublication is a structured, machine-readable unit containing:

- **Assertion** — The core claim or statement
- **Provenance** — Who made it, when, and how  
- **Publication Info** — Metadata and licensing

All published to the decentralized nanopublication network, ensuring:

- Permanent, citable scholarly objects
- Full traceability to original sources
- Machine-readable for automated discovery
- Interoperable with global knowledge graphs
