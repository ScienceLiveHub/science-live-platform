# Getting Started with Science Live

Welcome to Science Live! This guide will help you start creating and discovering structured, machine-readable research knowledge in just a few minutes.

## What You'll Need

### ORCID Account (Required for Publishing)

Science Live uses [ORCID](https://orcid.org) for authentication to ensure proper attribution for your contributions.

**Don't have an ORCID yet?**

1. Visit [orcid.org/register](https://orcid.org/register)
2. Create your free account (takes 2 minutes)
3. Your ORCID gives you a persistent digital identifier throughout your career

**Why ORCID?**

- Free for all researchers
- Globally recognized across journals and institutions
- Proper attribution for all your contributions
- Works regardless of name changes or institutional moves

!!! tip "Browsing Without an Account"
    You can browse and search nanopublications without authentication. ORCID is only required to create and publish your own nanopublications.

## Choose Your Path

Science Live offers two main ways to create nanopublications:

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   **🌐 Web Platform**

    ---

    Create nanopublications directly in your browser using our intuitive web interface.

    **Best for:**
    
    - First-time users exploring the platform
    - Creating one-off nanopublications
    - Searching and discovering research
    - Working without specific reference management software

-   **📚 Zotero Plugin**

    ---

    Integrate nanopublication creation into your existing Zotero workflow.

    **Best for:**
    
    - Active Zotero users
    - Annotating papers as you read
    - Managing large reference libraries
    - Creating multiple nanopublications efficiently

## Using the Web Platform

### Sign In

1. Navigate to [platform.sciencelive4all.org](https://platform.sciencelive4all.org)
2. Click **Sign in with ORCID**
3. Authorize Science Live to access your ORCID profile

### Create Your First Nanopublication

1. Click **Create Nanopublication** from the dashboard
2. Choose a template:
    - **CiTO (Citation)** — Describe relationships between papers
    - **AIDA (Assertion)** — Make formal research claims
    - **Quote & Comment** — Annotate specific quotes from papers
    - **Geographic Coverage** — Document study locations
    - And more...
3. Fill in the form (many fields auto-populate if you provide a paper DOI)
4. Click **Generate Nanopublication** to preview
5. Review the structured output
6. Click **Publish** to make it permanent

**Your first nanopublication is now live!** 🎉

### Explore and Discover

Once you're comfortable creating nanopublications, explore the platform's discovery features:

- **Search** — Find nanopublications across all disciplines
- **Browse by Topic** — Explore specific research domains
- **View Connections** — See how research is linked
- **Track Impact** — Monitor citations and reuse
- **Follow Researchers** — Stay updated on work in your field

## Understanding Nanopublications

Nanopublications are the building blocks of Science Live. Each nanopublication is a tiny, citable piece of machine-readable scientific knowledge.

### Structure

Every nanopublication contains three parts:

**Assertion** — The core claim or statement  
*Example: "Paper A supports the findings of Paper B"*

**Provenance** — Who made it, when, and how  
*Example: "Created by Jane Smith (ORCID: 0000-0002-1234-5678) on 2026-02-15"*

**Publication Info** — Metadata and licensing  
*Example: "Published under CC BY 4.0 license at https://w3id.org/np/..."*

### Benefits

- **Permanent & Citable** — Each nanopub has a persistent URI
- **Machine-Readable** — Semantic web standards (RDF/OWL)
- **Fully Traceable** — Complete provenance from claim to source
- **Globally Connected** — Part of the decentralized nanopub network

## Available Templates

Science Live provides templates for different types of research contributions:

| Template | Use Case | Example |
|----------|----------|---------|
| **CiTO Citation** | Describe paper relationships | "Paper A cites Paper B as authority" |
| **AIDA Assertion** | Make formal research claims | "Climate change affects migration patterns" |
| **Quote & Comment** | Annotate specific passages | Quote + your interpretation |
| **Geographic Coverage** | Document study locations | "Study area: Amazon rainforest (WKT coordinates)" |
| **Hypothesis** | State research hypotheses | "We hypothesize that X causes Y" |
| **Dataset** | Document research datasets | Dataset metadata and provenance |
| **Software** | Reference research software | Software used in analysis |
| **PRISMA** *(coming soon)* | Systematic review protocols | PRISMA flow diagrams |

Each template generates structured, standards-compliant RDF data that integrates with the global knowledge graph.

## Common Questions

**Q: Are nanopublications really permanent?**  
A: Yes! Once published to the decentralized nanopub network, they cannot be deleted. This ensures citability. You can publish new versions if needed.

**Q: Who can see my nanopublications?**  
A: Nanopublications are public by default on the open nanopub network. This enables discovery, citation, and reuse.

**Q: Can I edit a published nanopublication?**  
A: No, but you can publish a new version that supersedes the original. The original remains for citation purposes.

**Q: Do I need to pay?**  
A: The Explorer tier is **free forever**. Advanced features unlock through quality contributions (10 nanopubs + 5 validations), not payment.

**Q: What if my paper doesn't have a DOI?**  
A: You can use any persistent URI — arXiv URLs, institutional repository links, etc.

**Q: How do I cite a nanopublication?**  
A: Each nanopublication has a persistent URI (https://w3id.org/np/...) that serves as its permanent citation.

**Q: Should I use the Web Platform or Zotero Plugin?**  
A: If you're already a Zotero user, the plugin integrates seamlessly into your workflow. Otherwise, the web platform is easier to get started with.
